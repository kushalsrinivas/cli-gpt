 # Multi-Step Task Handling Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-step task handling system for the CLI Agent with the following architecture:

## Architecture Components

### 1. CoordinatorAgent (`src/coordinatorAgent.js`)
- **Role**: Main orchestrator that routes tasks and manages overall execution
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic task complexity detection
  - Routes single-step tasks to original Agent
  - Routes multi-step tasks to PlannerAgent → ExecutorAgent workflow
  - Handles plan execution with progress tracking
  - User intervention for failures
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 2. PlannerAgent (`src/plannerAgent.js`)
- **Role**: Specialized agent for task analysis and plan creation
- **Key Features**:
  - AI-powered multi-step task detection
  - Detailed execution plan generation with JSON structure
  - Plan persistence to `.cliagent/plans/` directory
  - Risk assessment and strategy formulation
  - Plan loading and management utilities

### 3. ExecutorAgent (`src/executorAgent.js`)
- **Role**: Specialized agent for executing individual plan steps
- **Key Features**:
  - Step-by-step execution with THINK→ACTION→OBSERVE loop
  - Retry logic with configurable max attempts
  - Success criteria validation
  - Interactive failure handling (retry, skip, modify, abort)
  - Step modification capabilities

## New Output Modes

### ANALYZE Mode
```json
{
  "mode": "ANALYZE",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-18T21:06:48.855Z",
  "task": "user task",
  "analysis": {
    "isMultiStep": true/false,
    "reasoning": "explanation",
    "complexity": "low|medium|high",
    "estimatedSteps": number
  }
}
```

### PLAN Mode
```json
{
  "mode": "PLAN",
  "status": "CREATING|CREATED|FAILED",
  "plan": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "steps": number,
    "strategy": "execution strategy",
    "risks": "risk assessment"
  }
}
```

### EXECUTE_PLAN Mode
```json
{
  "mode": "EXECUTE_PLAN",
  "status": "STARTING|STEP_PROGRESS|COMPLETED|ABORTED",
  "plan": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "currentStep": 1,
    "totalSteps": 3
  }
}
```

### EXECUTE_STEP Mode
```json
{
  "mode": "EXECUTE_STEP",
  "status": "STARTING|COMPLETED|FAILED|RETRYING",
  "step": {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "step description",
    "tool": "toolName",
    "attempt": 1,
    "maxAttempts": 3
  }
}
```

## Plan Structure

Plans are saved as JSON files in `.cliagent/plans/` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "plan_id": "uuid",
  "original_task": "user task",
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "estimated_duration": "time estimate",
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "description": "what to do",
      "tool": "toolName",
      "parameters": {"param": "value"},
      "success_criteria": "how to know it succeeded",
      "error_handling": "what to do if it fails",
      "status": "PENDING|EXECUTING|COMPLETED|FAILED|SKIPPED",
      "attempts": 0,
      "max_attempts": 3,
      "started_at": "ISO timestamp",
      "completed_at": "ISO timestamp",
      "result": "execution result"
    }
  ],
  "overall_strategy": "high-level approach",
  "risk_assessment": "potential issues"
}
```

## CLI Commands Added

### Plan Management
```bash
# List all execution plans
cliagent list-plans

# Show details of a specific plan  
cliagent show-plan <plan-id>

# Resume execution of a plan
cliagent resume-plan <plan-id> [--json] [--verbose]
```

## Error Handling & User Intervention

### Step Failure Handling
When a step fails after max attempts, users can:
1. **Retry** - Reset attempts and try again
2. **Skip** - Mark step as skipped and continue
3. **Modify** - Change step description, tool, or parameters
4. **Abort** - Stop entire plan execution

### Plan Failure Handling
When plan execution encounters issues, users can:
1. **Skip step and continue** - Mark failed step as skipped
2. **Continue with failure** - Mark step as failed but continue
3. **Abort entire plan** - Stop execution

## Resume & Retry Capabilities

### Resuming Plans
- Plans automatically resume from the first PENDING step
- Completed and skipped steps are preserved
- Failed steps can be retried or skipped

### Retry Logic
- Each step has configurable max attempts (default: 3)
- Automatic retry for recoverable errors
- User intervention for non-recoverable failures

## Integration Points

### CLI Integration
- Updated `src/cli.js` to use CoordinatorAgent instead of Agent
- Maintains backward compatibility for single-step tasks
- Added new plan management commands

### Agent Inheritance
- All new agents inherit from the original Agent class
- Preserves existing functionality and tools
- Extends with specialized capabilities

## Testing Results

✅ **Single-step task detection** - Correctly routes simple tasks to original agent
✅ **Multi-step task detection** - AI successfully identifies complex tasks
✅ **Plan creation** - Generates detailed execution plans with proper structure
✅ **Step execution** - Executes steps with proper THINK→ACTION→OBSERVE flow
✅ **Plan persistence** - Saves plans to disk for recovery
✅ **Plan management** - CLI commands work for listing, showing, and resuming plans
✅ **Error handling** - Proper failure detection and status tracking

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Structured Multi-Step Execution** - Complex tasks broken down systematically
2. **Intelligent Task Routing** - Automatic detection preserves performance for simple tasks
3. **Robust Error Handling** - Multiple failure recovery strategies
4. **User Control** - Interactive intervention options for failures
5. **Persistence & Recovery** - Plans survive interruptions and can be resumed
6. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time visibility into execution status
7. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing functionality preserved

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Parallel step execution for independent steps
- Plan templates for common task patterns
- Step dependency management
- Integration with external services (S3, email, etc.)
- Plan scheduling and automation
- Performance metrics and analytics
